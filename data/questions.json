Step 3: Then we place the values of R=5 and E=8 resulting in N=3 with carry 1. Step 4:  In ten�s digits � E=8 and and value of C could be 3,4,6 (As all others are occupied) and to make I=7 (previously assigned in step 2) E must be added by 9 which is already occupied by S. Now start again with reduced value of E or I, repeat above steps until you get a correct\nanswer or a dead end. Step 5: Repeating above steps one time comes with E=5 and I=7 which results in R=3 carry=1. Step 6: Placing R=3 and E=5 in unit digits and their sum gives 8. Step 7:  in ten�s digits place E=5 now you can add 2 to make I=7 hence C=2. Step 8: in 100�s digits you have N=8 (from step 6)and only digits that are left now are 4 and 6 hence.

    "Solution": "Let's use the alligation rule to solve this:\n% fat in 1st milk  20\n% fat in 2nd milk  50\n% fat in mixture    30\nDifference between 2nd milk and mixture = 50 - 30 = 20\nDifference between mixture and 1st milk = 30 - 20 = 10\nRatio of 1st milk to 2nd milk = 20:10 = 2:1\nSo, the milkman should mix 2 parts of the 20% fat milk with 1 part of the 50% fat milk.\nTo get 100 liters of the mixture, he should take:\n2/3 � 100 = 66.67 liters of 20% fat milk\n1/3 � 100 = 33.33 liters of 50% fat milk",
